Collection of thoughts and designs for Elon Musks Hyperloop system

# Overview

Elon proposed two possible designs for the Hyperloop:

1) A Passenger-only version that could just carry passenger capsules

2) A Passenger-Car version that can carry passengers, vehicles, and freight

In my analysis, I think it's only worthwhile to pursue option number 2 since it will create a far more versatile Hyperloop system, for only slightly more than the Passenger-only version.

The repository just be a place for data files, CAD files, sketches, images, etc associated with this project and distilled thoughts/discussions are on the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenHyperloop/OpenHyperloop/wiki).

# Request for Data

In the original document from Elon, he implies he has several CAD design files and simulation results that he has already analyzed.  If someone knows where these are, or if Elon could contribute the data files he already has, that would give this project a good start.  Also, Elon appeared to have a Google Earth route in mind, so having that kml/kmz file would also help in planning.

# Request for Contributions

If you are an engineer (CFD, Structural, Industrial, etc), architect, graphic designer, etc and want to contribute, please feel free.  We need full component designs and simulation data on the various components to ensure they will behave as expected.  Architects can get started on an ideal design for the stations so they are warm, inviting and functional.  Graphic designers can get started on logos, fonts, and graphics for promoting Hyperloop transportation.

# Usage of the repository/wiki

As stated above, if you have a thought on the designs, it goes in the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenHyperloop/OpenHyperloop/wiki) for this project.  If you have a CAD file, image, mockup, video, etc, then it goes into the repository.
